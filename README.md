1. the main code base is under `code` folder, including our pre-trained models as well
2. the KNN and MLP screen and widget classifiers are under `KNNClassifier` and `MLP_Screen_Widget_Classification`, respectively
3. the definitions of canonical screens and canonical widgets are under `IR` folder
4. the intermediate embeddings output by our classifiers are under `embeddings` folder
5. the IR Models, generated tests, and intermediate results (e.g., screenshots, cropped widgets, reverse engineered UI layout hierarchy) are under `output` folder
6. the processed video frames, screenshots, cropped widgets, keyboard classifier's results of all the usages are under `usage_data` folder
