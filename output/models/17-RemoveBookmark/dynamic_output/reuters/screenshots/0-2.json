"The Russian and Ukrainian governments on Friday signalled an openness to negotiations even as authorities in Kyiv urged citizens to help defend the capital from advancing Russian forces in the worst European security crisis in decades.\n\nUkraine and Russia will consult in coming hours on a time and place for talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on social media, offering the first glimmer of hope for diplomacy since the invasion began.\n\nThe Kremlin said earlier it offered to meet in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine expressed a willingness to discuss declaring itself a neutral country, but that Ukraine had proposed Warsaw as the venue. That, according to Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, resulted in a \"pause\" in contacts.\n\n\"Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,\" Nykyforov said in a post on Facebook. \"We agreed to the proposal of the President of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nBut U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia's offer was an attempt to conduct diplomacy \"at the barrel of a gun\", and that President Vladimir Putin's military must stop bombing Ukraine if it was serious about negotiations.\n\nThe diplomatic overtures stood in stark contrast to events unfolding on the ground and Putin's harsh rhetoric against Ukrainian leaders, including a call for a coup by the country's military.\n\nKyiv residents were told by the defence ministry to make petrol bombs to repel the invaders, and on Friday evening witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of the city. The sound of frequent artillery fire, apparently some distance from the city center, continued in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nZelenskiy filmed himself with aides on the streets of the capital, vowing to defend Ukraine's independence. \n\n\"Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,\" he said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel. \"The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"\n\nSome families cowered in shelters after Kyiv was pounded on Thursday night by Russian missiles. Others tried desperately to get on packed trains headed west, some of the hundreds of thousands who have left their homes to find safety, according to the United Nations' aid chief. \n\nAfter weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday, in an attack that threatened to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.\n\n\"I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis and (Ukrainian radical nationalists) to use your children, wives and elders as human shields,\" Putin said at a televised meeting with Russia's Security Council on Friday. \"Take power into your own hands.\"\n\nPutin has cited the need to \"denazify\" Ukraine's leadership as one of his main reasons for invasion, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss the accusations as baseless propaganda.\n", "bounds": [39, 1504, 1041, 1794]}], "bounds": [39, 1343, 1041, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 210, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 63, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 63, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 63, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 63, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 63, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 0, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 0, 1080, 1794]}], "bounds": [0, 0, 1440, 2560]}}}
